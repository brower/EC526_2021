To run  on command line.

module load gcc
module load  mvapich/2.3.3

mpicc  mpi_hello.c -o mpi_hello

mpirun -np  64  ./mpi_hello

The default here is one node with -np # treads
To allocate more than one node you need to use

 qrsh -pe mpi_12_tasks_per_node 24

which is "-pe mpi_12_tasks_per_node"  with 24 total
(i.e 24/12 nodes) This take time to get the node so
let's not do this now.
